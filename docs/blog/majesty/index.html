I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author."</p></blockquote><p><p>In the annals of fantasy literature and the broader realm of creative world-building, few sagas can rival the intricate tapestry woven by J.R.R.
